title: Notes on "Good Strategy Bad Strategy"
---

I found [Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11721966-good-strategy-bad-strategy) by Richard P. Rumelt interesting and useful. It covers strategy at the level of a business competing in the marketplace. I think much of the advice can apply to individual software teams too.

*Selected Notes*:
- Hope is not a strategy. Neither is "outworking the competition."
- A good strategy consists of 3 parts:
    1. Diagnosis of the current situation
         -  Quote: "A great deal of strategy is figuring out 'what's going on here?'" 
    2. Guiding policy - General plan for dealing with the obstacles identified in the diagnosis
    3. Coherent Action - Feasible actions to carry out the guiding policy
- Good strategy can't be easily copied. Related: [Seven Powers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32816087-7-powers).
- Bad strategy often employs:
    - Ambitious goals with nothing to back them up. Example: "After growing 5% last year, we're going to grow 20% this year!" The book's response to this kind of "strategy:" Great! How?
    - Bad objectives - Focusing on the wrong things, failing to address obvious issues, or simply impractical 
- **"Strategy is scarcity's child"**
- People's strong tendency to compromise is a source of bad strategy (Example: "Let's make sure everyone's thoughts are represented in this strategy").
- Be aware of limiting factors around a strategy
    - For example, an investor looking to flip homes would want to avoid investing in homes with issues that they couldn't fix. So, if the investor specialized in flipping homes with plumbing problems, they would want to avoid a house with plumbing problems that's in a bad location. No matter how great of a job they did on the plumbing problems, the location would still limit the overall value of the house.
- Strategy is design, not picking from a list of curated options.
- "Leaders who stay above the details may do well in stable times but riding a wave of change requires an intimate feel for its origins and dynamics"
- Good strategy is based on functional knowledge of what works, what doesn't, and why.
- Evaluating choices
    - People often predictably make poor judgements in certain situations. For example, they will favor vivid examples over statistical evidence
    - People have a strong tendency to go with the first good option they see when things are murky
